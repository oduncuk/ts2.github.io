<h3>2013-10-13: TS2 v0.3 is released !</h3>

<p>
    We are happy to announce the release of version 0.3 of TS2.
    This version features:
<ul>
    <li>A simulation editor for everyone to easily create new simulations</li>
    <li>A new full-featured simulation "Liverpool Street" with 700 trains to
        cope with !
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>2013-08-03: TS2 development started again !</h3>

<p>
    After 5 years of inactivity, development of ts2 started again! <br/>
    For this occasion, development site moved to GitHub (check <a
        href="https://github.com/npiganeau/ts2">https://github.com/npiganeau/ts2</a>)
    and
    the software has been ported from C++ to Python in the hope to get faster
    coding.<br/>
    Homepage and release files remain on sourceforge.<br/>
    The next release (v0.3) will focus on adding a simulation editor to ts2 so
    that users can create their own simulations
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>TS2 main features are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Real-time simulation of a train signalling control centre</li>
    <li>Multi-platform (MS Windows, MAC OS X, Linux and other UNIX variants)
    </li>
    <li>Simulations are file based and can be edited by users within the editor
        included in the software
    </li>
    <li>Everything can be changed through the editor, including scenery layout,
        allowed routes, timetables and train characteristics (speed,
        acceleration, braking, length, ...)
    </li>
    <li>Simulation scenes have no limitation in size or arrangement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<p>
    TS2 is now beta software which means that it is usable but still lacks many
    features that I have planned for the version 1.0.<br/>
    Please post to the forum or the mailing list the features you want in TS2 so
    I can code accordingly.
</p>

<h3>How to contribute</h3>

<p>Contributors are always welcome! Here is a list of things you can do:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create simulations for TS2 using the integrated editor.</li>
    <li>Translate the application.</li>
    <li>Write user documentation for TS2.</li>
    <li>Send the features you would like to see in TS2 by opening up an issue on
